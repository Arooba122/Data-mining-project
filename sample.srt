00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,799
<i>I believe we have a choice in this
world about how to tell sad stories.</i>

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,639
<i>On the one hand,
you can sugarcoat it.</i>

3
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,239
<i>The way they do in movies
and romance novels...</i>

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,799
<i>where beautiful people
learn beautiful lessons...</i>

5
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,079
<i>where nothing is too messed
up that can't be fixed...</i>

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,603
<i>with an apology
and a Peter Gabriel song.</i>

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,319
<i>I like that version as much
as the next girl does,</i>

8
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,081
<i>believe me.</i>

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,929
<i>It's just not the truth.</i>

10
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,406
<i>This is the truth.</i>

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,961
<i>Sorry.</i>

12
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>Late in the winter
of my seventeenth year...</i>

13
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,759
<i>my mother decided
that I was depressed.</i>

14
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,319
She just eats like a bird,
she barely leaves the house.

15
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,999
I am not depressed, Mom.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,839
She's reading the same
book over and over.

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,999
She's depressed.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,559
I'm not depressed.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,039
<i>The booklets and the websites
always list depression as</i>

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,399
<i>a side effect of cancer.</i>
